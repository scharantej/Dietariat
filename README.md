## Flask Application Design - "Best Foods for Health Goals"

## HTML Files:

1. `index.html`:
   - Entry point of the application.
   - Contains the user interface for selecting health goals, dietary restrictions, and geographic location.
   - Form elements for user input, such as radio buttons for health goals, text fields for dietary restrictions, and a drop-down menu for geographic location.
   - A submit button to send user input to the server.

2. `results.html`:
   - Displays the recommended foods based on the user's input from `index.html`.
   - Includes a list of recommended foods, organized by category (e.g., protein, fruits, vegetables).
   - Additional information such as serving size, nutritional value, and recipe ideas can be included.

## Routes:

1. `/`:
   - Handles GET requests to the home page.
   - Renders the `index.html` file, presenting the user with the form for inputting health goals, dietary restrictions, and geographic location.

2. `/results`:
   - Handles POST requests from the form on `index.html`.
   - Receives user input and processes it using business logic (can be implemented in a separate Python module) to determine the best foods to meet the user's health goals, dietary restrictions, and geographic location.
   - Renders the `results.html` file, displaying the list of recommended foods.
